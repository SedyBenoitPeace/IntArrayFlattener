The following repository contains the small App for this project:
"Write some code that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]"

The chosen programming language is C#.

The main classes are IntArrayFlattener/Flattener.cs and they can be opened via any text editor.

The IDE of choice was of course Visual Studio 2019, so also the .sln file can be opened and displayed, and while I could've provided an exe also for this one, the project is so small and it has Unit Tests just in case.
